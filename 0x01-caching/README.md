**General**

A caching system is a mechanism that stores frequently accessed data in a temporary storage area, called a cache, to improve the performance and efficiency of data retrieval.

FIFO (First-In, First-Out) is a caching algorithm where the least recently used item is evicted from the cache when it is full.

LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) is a caching algorithm where the most recently used item is evicted from the cache when it is full.

LRU (Least Recently Used) is a caching algorithm where the least recently accessed item is evicted from the cache when it is full.

MRU (Most Recently Used) is a caching algorithm where the most recently accessed item is evicted from the cache when it is full.

LFU (Least Frequently Used) is a caching algorithm where the least frequently accessed item is evicted from the cache when it is full.

The purpose of a caching system is to reduce the time and resources required to access frequently used data by storing it in a faster and more accessible location.

Caching systems have limitations such as limited cache size, the need for eviction policies to determine which items to remove from the cache, and the potential for stale or outdated data if not properly managed.

**Requirements**

- Python Scripts
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc
- All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
